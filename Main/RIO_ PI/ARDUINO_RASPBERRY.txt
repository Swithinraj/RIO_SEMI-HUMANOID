HInt for connection:
Simply run ls /dev/tty* and you should see it. At this point if you’re not sure which device is the Arduino board,
 simply disconnect the board (remove the USB cable), and run ls /dev/tty* again.
 This way you will easily spot the serial device name of your Arduino.

Also, you may want to add your user to the dialout group, to avoid errors such as: 
serial.serialutil.SerialException: [Errno 13] could not open port /dev/ttyACM0: [Errno 13] Permission denied: ‘/dev/ttyACM0’.

$ sudo adduser your_username dialout
This will make sure you have access to Serial devices (/dev/ttyACMx, /dev/ttyUSBx, …).
python3 -m pip install pyserial
This Python library is well-known and used in a lot of applications.

When installing, if you get an error such as “/usr/bin/python3: No module named pip”,
 then you need to install pip first with sudo apt install python3-pip.
